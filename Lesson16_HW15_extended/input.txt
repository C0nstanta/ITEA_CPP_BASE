How the list is updated
The vocabulary of English changes over time, with words being added and other
words falling into disuse. In order to maintain its currency, the Preliminary and
Preliminary for Schools Vocabulary List is updated on an annual basis, with the decision
to add or remove words being informed by reference to the Cambridge Learner Corpus
and English Profile Wordlists.
The Cambridge Learner Corpus is a collection of over 44 million words of English,
based upon evidence of language use by learners from all over the world and from
which the English Vocabulary Profile has developed. The English Vocabulary Profile
shows the most common words and phrases that learners of English need to know in
British or American English. The meaning of each word or phrase in the wordlists has
been assigned a level between A1 and B2 on the CEFR.
A preview version of the English Vocabulary Profile can be accessed by visiting

Organisation of the list
â€¢ Word sets
Some categories of words that a learner at this level might be expected to know, e.g.
days of the week, are not included in the alphabetical list but are listed in Appendix 1.
Although 'grammar words' (pronouns, modal verbs, etc.) are included, the 'Language
Specification' section of the Preliminary and Preliminary for Schools
Handbook (available from http://www.cambridgeenglish.org/) should be consulted
for a more complete listing.
